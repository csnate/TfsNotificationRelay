## Installation

### Slack

1. If you don't already have one, add an Incoming WebHooks integration under *Configure Integrations* in Slack.
2. Download the latest [release][0] or clone and build the source yourself.
3. Open `DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.dll.config` and set at least your full unique Webhook URL in `slackWebhookUrl`. There are more [settings and formats][1] in there that should be somewhat self-explanatory.
4. Install the plugin by dropping `DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.dll`, `DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.Slack.dll`, `DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.dll.config` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` in *C:\Program Files\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 12.0\Application Tier\Web Services\bin\Plugins* on the server.

### HipChat

1. Create a room notification token for the HipChat room that you want to send notifications to.
2. Download the latest [release][0] or clone and build the source yourself.
3. Open `DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.dll.config` and set at least `roomNotificationToken` and the corresponding `room` setting. There are more [settings and formats][1] in there that should be somewhat self-explanatory.
4. Install the plugin by dropping `DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.dll`, `DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.HipChat.dll`, `DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.dll.config` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` in *C:\Program Files\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 12.0\Application Tier\Web Services\bin\Plugins* on the server.

### IRC

See [TfsBot](https://github.com/kria/TfsBot).

## Configuration

See the [wiki](https://github.com/kria/TfsNotificationRelay/wiki) for more information.

## Extending TfsNotificationRelay

TfsNotificationRelay can easily be extended to send notifications to other services. Notifier modules referenced in the configuration file will be loaded dynamically at run time, so TfsNotificationRelay doesn't have to be recompiled.

1. Start a new class library project.
2. Add a reference to DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.dll.
3. Create a class that implements the single method in `INotifier`. Take a look at the `SlackNotifier` class for pointers.
4. Build and drop in your new dll in the Plugins directory on the server.
5. Add a new bot element in `DevCore.TfsNotificationRelay.dll.config` with the correct assembly-qualified type name and settings.

## TFS version support

There are two separate [releases][0]  of TfsNotificationRelay:

* **TfsNotificationRelay for TFS 2013** - Should work on TFS 2013.2 and up. Because of a few breaking API changes in TFS 2013.2, the plugin won't work on previous versions without some minor modifications.
* **TfsNotificationRelay for TFS 2015**
